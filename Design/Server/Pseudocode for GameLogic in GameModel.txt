Pseudocode for GameLogic in GameModel.cpp

- The server.run() method pushes the Update commands for each running game to the workqueue on deltaTime.
- The server creates a command for each of the update methods with a gameID

Pseudocode for UpdateMinions()

// Iterate through all the minions in the gameID
	//Update position using the speed 
	(no pathing logic right now because no map or pathing info exists)

	//If minion is dead (health<=0)
		//remove MpS (Mana per second) from player who owns the minion
		//find all the towers' target lists this minion is in and remove itself from them

	//Check for collision with the enemy base
		//if there is a collision
			//do damage to enemy base
			//despawn minion

// let the clients in this game know to update it's minions

Pseudocode for UpdateTowers()

// loop through all towers in this game
	//loop through all minions in the game
		//if the minion is in range of the tower
		//check if the minion is already present in the tower's target list

		//if the minion does NOT exist in the tower's target list already
			//if the minion is in range
				//add minion to this tower's target list

		//if the minion is already in the tower's target list
			//if minion moves past tower's range, remove it from the target list

		//check if the tower's reload timer is up
			//if yes, the tower fires at the first minion in it's target list

//let the clients in this game know to update it's towers

Pseudocode for UpdateProjectiles()

// iterate through all the projectiles in the game
	//move projectile based on it's velocity

	//loop through all the minions in the game

		//check for collision with the minion
			//if there is a collision
				//do damage calculation based on tower's damage, minion's armour and resistances

			//despawn projectile after doing damage

//let the clients in this game know to update it's projectiles

Pseudocode for UpdateEconomy

	//loop through all players in the gameID
		//add MpS value to total mana
	//let client's know to update their MpS and Mana values
